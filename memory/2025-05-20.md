## Today's Progress

- Successfully installed OpenCode globally via npm (v0.0.1)
- Installed Open Code Controller skill from ClawHub
- Google Anti-Gravity plugin enabled and loaded
- Gateway restarted to apply plugin changes

## Challenges Encountered

- Multiple failed attempts to run open-code command directly
- Errors about command not recognized and executable couldn't be determined
- Tried various execution methods (npx, direct binary, node scripts) without success
- Tool appears to be web-based, requiring browser environment (window is not defined errors)

## Key Learnings

- OpenCode is a browser-based tool, not a CLI executable
- Need to understand proper setup and usage of OpenCode as a coding agent
- Google API key configuration still needed for Anti-Gravity plugin

## Next Steps

1. Get Google API key from Google Cloud Console
2. Configure OpenClaw to use Google API key for Anti-Gravity plugin
3. Set up model selection for both Google Anti-Gravity and OpenCode
4. Test the workflow by routing a coding task to OpenCode sub-agent

## Configuration

- OpenClaw config file: `C:\Users\lucai\.openclaw\openclaw.json`
- Current auth profile: `openrouter:default` with API key mode
- Plugin enabled: `google-antigravity-auth` (loaded status)
- OpenCode installed at: `C:\Users\lucai\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\open-code`
