# 2026-02-16 — Universal Health App Build

## Session Summary

- Using OpenCode Build agent (Big Pickle / free model) for code generation
- Antigravity plans → OpenCode executes

## Phase 1 — COMPLETED ✅
- OpenCode Build agent (session `briny-pine`) scaffolded the entire project
- Session crashed (SIGKILL) but most files were already generated
- Restarted as session `young-atlas` — completed navigation, ProfileScreen, App.tsx wiring
- TypeScript compiles clean
- Two commits pushed to GitHub:
  1. `4dbdea8` — Foundation scaffolding (33 files)
  2. `a7f7a48` — Navigation setup, ProfileScreen, App.tsx wiring (5 files)

### Files Created
- App.tsx, index.ts, app.json, tsconfig.json, package.json
- src/components/ — Button, Input, Loading, ErrorView, HealthCard, SleepChart
- src/screens/auth/ — LoginScreen, RegisterScreen, ForgotPasswordScreen
- src/screens/main/ — DashboardScreen, DevicesScreen, ProfileScreen
- src/navigation/ — AppNavigator (auth flow + bottom tabs)
- src/services/ — firebase.ts, terra.ts
- src/stores/ — authStore, healthStore (Zustand)
- src/types/, src/utils/, src/constants/

## Phase 2 — COMPLETED ✅
- Started at ~20:55 CET, finished at ~21:25 CET
- OpenCode session `delta-falcon` completed all 9 tasks
- Committed as `4ac3f99` — 12 files changed, 1,778 insertions
- Pushed to GitHub successfully

### What was built:
1. **Types** — BodyRegion, HealthStatus, BodyRegionData, RegionMetric, ExtendedHealthData
2. **Health Score Engine** (`src/utils/healthScoreEngine.ts`) — calculates overall + per-region scores
3. **DigitalTwinAvatar.tsx** — SVG body with 8 interactive color-coded regions + pulse effects
4. **BiometricDisplay.tsx** — real-time metrics (HR, SpO2, stress, sleep, HRV, respiratory rate)
5. **BodyRegionDetail.tsx** — modal with detailed per-system metrics + progress bars + health advice
6. **DigitalTwinScreen.tsx** — main screen integrating all components
7. **healthStore** updated with extendedHealthData + selectedRegion
8. **Navigation** — added "My Twin" tab
9. **react-native-svg** installed, TypeScript compiles clean

## Key Info
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/lucbrinkcate-cloud/universal-health (private)
- User is away for a couple hours, wants 15-min updates
- User: lucbrinkcate-cloud on GitHub
- Dead sessions: quiet-seaslug (Plan), brisk-comet (killed), briny-pine (killed), young-atlas (completed then died)

## Late Evening (~23:30)
- User checked in, confirmed Phase 2 completion
- Asked what model OpenCode uses — it's **Google/Gemini** (API key auth, free tier)
- OpenCode coding-agent workspace only has `auth-profiles.json` with a google API key
- Exact Gemini model variant unknown (no config file persisted), would need to launch OpenCode `/models` to check
- Phase 2 monitoring cron (`build-progress-15min`) was removed after completion
- User hasn't started Phase 3 yet — it's late (23:30+)
